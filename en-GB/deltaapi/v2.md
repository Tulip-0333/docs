# Delta API (v2 preview)

> The Delta API should be considered as a preview. Some stuff in it will be changed before its final release. You can use it if you want, but we do not recommend it yet. Once the delta API is complete, we'll state a list of the breaking changes so you can adapt your code to work with the final v2 version

The Delta API is an API built and designed specifically for interacting with Ripple's Bancho server emulator (delta). The base URL is:

```bash
https://c.ripple.moe/api/v2
```

E.g., the URL for a GET /ping request would be

```bash
https://c.ripple.moe/api/v2/ping
```

General indications specified by [the Appendix](appendix) apply here.

## Miscellaneous

### GET /ping

Check the API is alive and returns the version of delta.

#### Response

Field name | Type | Value
-----------|------|-------
`version` | `string` | Delta's version

#### Examples

```http
$ http https://c.ripple.moe/api/v2/ping
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Server: nginx

{
    "code": 200,
    "version": "19.0.0"

## Chat Channels

### GET /chat_channels

Allows to retreive all (or part some of the) currently registered chat channels.

#### Parameters

Name | Description | Required? | Default
-----|-------------|-----------|---------
`private` | Boolean string. Returns private channels (admin only) | No | `false`
`public` | Boolean string. Returns public channels (read or write, includes `#announce`) | No | `false`
`permanent` | Boolean string. Returns permanent channels, basically all chat channels visible in the channels listing. | No | `false`
`temporary` | Boolean string. Returns temporary channels (`#multi_*`, `#spect_*`). | No | `false`
`all` | Boolean string. Shorthand for `TEMPORARY &#124; PERMANENT &#124; PUBLIC &#124; PRIVATE` | No | `true`

* By default, the filter is `ALL`, meaning that all channels will be returned: public channels like `#osu`, `#english`, etc as well as temporary channels like all `#spectator` and `#multiplayer` channels.
* Please note that at least one between both `PRIVATE|PUBLIC` and `PERMANENT|TEMPORARY`
are needed to return at least one result (eg: `PRIVATE`, `TEMPORARY`, `TEMPORARY|PERMANENT`
are invalid filters, `PRIVATE|TEMPORARY` is valid)
* Also note that the `PRIVATE` flag will be ignored if the user who owns the provided token does not have the `ADMIN_CHAT_MOD` privileges (or if no token is provided at all)

### POST /clients/{api_identifier}/kick

Kicks a client from the server, forcing them to log in again.  

Please note that:

  * IRC clients will be kicked immediately
  * Game clients will be _marked_ as kicked and will be effectively kicked when they send the next request.
  This is due to how the bancho server emulator works internally. The next request may never come, in that case,
  the client will be logged out by the server's client manager, that periodically disposes all timed out clients.  
  _While a game client is marked as "kicked" but hasn't been kicked yet, it's still possible to retreive the information about that client through the Delta API._
